# EX03 — Collections (list + dict)
# Ask the user to enter 5 integers separated by spaces (example: "3 1 3 5 1").
# Store them in a list called numbers.
# Build a dictionary called counts where each key is a number from the list and each value is
# how many times that number appears.
# Print the list on the first line, then print the dictionary on the second line.

#creating an empty list and dictionary for preserving numbers
numbers = []
counts = {}

user_input = input("Enter 5 integers separated by spaces: ")
#splitting given sequence in parts, since "int(input)" is appropriate for only 1 number
parts = user_input.split()

# p - an element from parts. Append adds a number to "numbers" list
for p in parts:
    numbers.append(int(p))

for num in numbers:
    counts[num] = numbers.count(num)

print(numbers)
print(counts)
